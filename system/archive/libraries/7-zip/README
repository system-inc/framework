Need to download and compile versions of 7-Zip that support RAR5.

Download here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/p7zip/files/p7zip/

Extract the bz2 file and then the tar file to get all of the source code.

Run the command 'make all3'. You'll need a bunch of the compiling software installed.

After compilation finishes, all of the binaries will be in the bin folder.
